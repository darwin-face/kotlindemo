# Kotlin Test Spring Boot Application

This is an example Kotlin Rest API built by _darwin_face_

To run, use either `gradle bootRun`, or using your respective IDE of choice, it should be runable within.

Once running, you can go to `localhost:8080` and see a small example JSON payload, or go to `localhost:8080/butt/{name}`
and see an example REST call that takes in a URL Path Parameter.

### TODO:
- add Swagger
- add a POST call example
